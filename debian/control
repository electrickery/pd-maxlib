Description: a Pd library for analysing musical performance
 maxlib is a library of non-tilde externals for Pd. The objects can be very
 useful to analyse any musical performance. Some of the objects are 'borrowed'
 from Max (they are not ported but rewritten for Pd cheap immitations). maxlib
 has recently been extended by objects of more general use and some which can
 be use for composition purposes.
