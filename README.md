maxlib - music analysis extensions library
copyright (c) 2002-2003 by Olaf Matthes

This git-fork of the Pure-data library maxlib is cloned from https://git.puredata.info/cgit/svn2git/libraries/maxlib.git, which is the svn-to-git from https://sourceforge.net/p/pure-data/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/externals/maxlib/.

The initial changes were adding/recreating some separate directories for source and help files and replace the buildsystem by pdlibbiulder. This to simplify creation of a deken package of the libary.

See the original README.txt for more information.
